but some important things.

- Code refactoring (for ex. remove repeating code)
- Add proper referencing in databases
- Add UNIQUE on name in users table in database
- A good and easy way to delete lists and cards
- A good way to edit lists and cards
- Rest of functionality and pages
- Add "login failed" when wrong password or username
- Add "registeration failed" when passwords dont match or username is taken
